In a few words, Emballo is a set of frameworks which aims to bring modern development techniques to Delphi Win32.

Currently, the project cover areas such as mocking, dependency injection, dynamic proxies, etc.

Although the oficial site of the project is this Google Code site, our source code is hosted on Bitbucket at http://bitbucket.org/magnomp/emballo

Even though Google Code does support Mercurial, we think Bitbucket make it easier for other people to participate on the project with source code. So, please don't rely on the source code hosted here at Google Code.
